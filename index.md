## My Programming Experience

I have worked with various languages including Python, Java, C/C++, and Arm Assembly.

Some people may claim that

> Assembly is pain and difficult to work with.

While I might agree that it can be difficult to learn, my response to that could be found [here](https://github.com/AAP127/cse110-lab-reports/tree/newbranch#readme).

My favorite example of assembly can be seen below:

```
mov 0, r1
mov 1, r2
mov r2, [r1]
```
(_This will cause a segmentation fault._)
